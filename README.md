# Mobilenet_Object_Detection
Rapid object detection suitable for implementation in autonomous vehicles.

Code from the UDACITY Object Detection Lab of the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. 

This optional lab exercise is an opportunity to practice rapid object detection suitable for implementation in autonomous vehicles. The current lab is focused on a general understanding of used SSD for object detection, as applied to detecting other vehicles from a driving video.
